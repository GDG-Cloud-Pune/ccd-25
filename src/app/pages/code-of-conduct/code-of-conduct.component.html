    <h3>Be excellent to each other</h3>
    <p>We want the event to be an excellent experience for everyone regardless of gender identity and expression, sexual
      orientation, disabilities, neurodiversity, physical appearance, body size, ethnicity, nationality, race, age,
      religion, or other protected category. Treat everyone with respect. Participate while acknowledging that everyone
      deserves to be here -- and each of us has the right to enjoy our experience without fear of harassment,
      discrimination, or condescension, whether blatant or via micro-aggressions. Jokes shouldn’t demean others.
      Consider what you are saying and how it would feel if it were said to or about you.

    <h3>Speak up if you see or hear something.</h3>
    <p>Harassment is not tolerated, and you are empowered to politely engage when you or others are disrespected. The
      person making you feel uncomfortable may not be aware of what they are doing, and politely bringing their behavior
      to their attention is encouraged. If a participant engages in harassing or uncomfortable behavior, the event
      organizers may take any action they deem appropriate, including warning or expelling the offender from the event
      with no refund. If you are being harassed or feel uncomfortable, notice that someone else is being harassed, or
      have any other concerns, please contact a member of the event staff immediately.

    <h3>Practice saying "Yes and" to each other.</h3>
    <p>It’s a theatre improv technique to build on each other’s ideas. We all benefit when we create together.

<div>
  <h3>We have a ZERO TOLERANCE POLICY for harassment of any kind.</h3>
  <p>Participants asked to stop any harassing behavior are expected to comply immediately. Our zero tolerance policy
    means that we will look into and review every allegation of violation of our Event Community Guidelines and
    Anti-Harassment Policy and respond appropriately. We empower and encourage you to report any behavior that makes you
    or others feel uncomfortable by finding a volunteer or organizer badge, or
    by emailing gdgcloudpune&#64;gmail.com.

    Any person behaving in a disorderly manner, engaging in harassing or uncomfortable behavior, or otherwise failing to
    comply with this policy may be removed from any GDG Cloud Pune hosted event or refused admittance (including to
    future
    events) at any time in GDG Cloud Pune’s sole discretion. Individuals who are expelled from an event for a violation
    of this policy will not be provided with a refund.
